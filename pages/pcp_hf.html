# For the equations, the values for age, lipids, BMI, fasting glucose, systolic BP, and QRS duration are Ln #transformed. Interactions use the natural log of each variable. Regression coefficients from Table 2 are used to calculate risk using the formula 1 − ᡅ⡨〲(㉘㊉㉹㉳ㄧ㉢㊀㉶㊉㉒㉱)where S0 represents baseline survival for the appropriate race-sex group, IndX represents the sum of the coefficient x value for each individual following log transformation where appropriate, and MeanCV represents the Mean (Coefficientxvalue) for the appropriate race-sex group.
